# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge solution

This is a solution to the [Shortly URL shortening API Challenge challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

### Links

- [Live Site URL](https://main.dk21oo3oocpv4.amplifyapp.com/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Local storage/session storage
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- CSS Modules

### Note
The URL shortender DOES NOT work. The recommended API is no longer available and I was unable to find a free API with the same features. It just generates a nonsense link.
